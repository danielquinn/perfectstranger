Social networking is doing some amazing things with our culture, but it's also
reinforcing some of our worst habits. The most glaring of these negatives is
the fact that while we're getting more and more information as-it-happens,
that information is being transmitted and filtered by our peers. This means
that our views on current events, politics, the environment, and even
entertainment are increasingly being seen through a potentially distorting
lens.

This wouldn't be a problem of course if people kept a diverse peer group, but
by our own nature, we don't. Economically left-leaning people tend to
associate themselves with other lefties, fundamentalist Christians usually
don't spend time with Pagans or Muslims, and as we become more dependent on
social media, this lack of connection to people who don't think like us can
distort our worldview.

[@perfectstranger](https://twitter.com/perfectstranger) is an attempt to
re-balance that dispairity. Every hour, the account will retweet a random
message from Twitter that adheres to the following rules:

* It is written in English
* It is a statement rather than a reply to someone else's comment (doesn't
  begin with `@`)
* It's an original statement, rather than a re-tweet ("RT") of another user.
* The original tweet author has fewer than 1000 followers. This is an attempt
  to reduce the frequency of tweet-spam and to give a stronger voice to
  non-famous "regular" people.

To take part, you need only follow [@perfectstranger](https://twitter.com/perfectstranger),
and feel free to tweet at us with your comments.
